# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes
The wireframes for ‘You Matter’ were produced in[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com).
There are frames for a full width display ( 1920 x 1080 )and a small mobile 
device (360 x 640). The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to bugs and design 
changes during development that occurred during the creation process.

## Design Chocies

## Fonts
* The font that I chose was Oswald, due to its striking visual impact.

* I tested out several fonts which struggled on visibility with the overlay 
  on the nav bar. Oswald font worked and is used for all the text on the 
  pages.

* The style of ‘You Matter’ website was designed to be easy to follow 
  and use.


* The style of you matter was choosen for the simple design of the website which is easy to follow and use.

## Color Scheme 
* The colour scheme of black and yellow were eventually chosen for the 
site. Originally, the site was red and black, however this was changed 
due to the poor text visibility present on the pages.
