# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes
The wireframes for you matter were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to bugs and desgin changes during development that occured during the creation process.

## Design Chocies

* #### Fonts
The font that I choose was Oswald due to viusal impact the font gave me on my prjoect. I tested out serveal fonts and struggled visibility on the overlay on the nav bar. Oswlad font is used for all the text on the pages.

* The style of you matter was choosen for the simple design of the website which is easy to follow and use.

* ### Color Scheme 
* Black and Yellow where eventually choosen for the project with some small, degsin changes to the sections due add more color to the pages. The orginal color that i started with was red and black this was changed to visibilty on the pages as the text was hard to read in certain places.
