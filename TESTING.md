# BUGS
The orginal design for you matter change a lot due to bugs and learning curves i faced during the development of this project. 

  1. Postion absoulte caused many issues when it came to my meida query moving everything out of alignment. I had to rewrite the code ,and remove postion abosulte from the source code.
  2. Button alignment on some the screen isn`t lined up correctly.
  3. Images size on tablet device doesn`t render with the correct width. Text goes out of alignnment on ipad. 
  4. During testing i had created a button inside a elemnet which caused errors during the validation so the code had to be rewritten.
